# Hi there 👋

Hey! Welcome to my GitHub. I'm a software developer who enjoys working with C# and Java, currently diving into web application deployment and backend development. I like building things that are efficient, scalable, and make sense.

### 🔧 What I Work With
I mess around with **C#, Java, and JavaScript**, and I’ve been exploring **ASP.NET Core** and **SQLite** quite a bit. Learning my way through **PostgreSQL** and **Docker**, because why not? Also, getting the hang of **WSL and Ubuntu Terminal** while trying to deploy projects with **Vercel**.

### 📌 What You’ll Find Here
I keep a mix of projects, including:
- My **portfolio website**, which is clean and minimalistic.
- Some **art-related web projects** (because tech + creativity = fun).
- API experiments, mostly using **ASP.NET Core with SQLite**.

### 🚀 What I’m Learning
Always looking to improve! Right now, I’m:
- Getting better at **PostgreSQL** for backend work.
- Leveling up my **ASP.NET Core** skills.
- Exploring **Docker** and containerization (still new to it, but making progress!).
